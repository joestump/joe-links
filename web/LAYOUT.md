# Web Assets

Templates live in web/templates/ (not the root templates/ directory).
Static assets live in web/static/ (not the root static/ directory).

The root templates/ and static/ directories written by the frontend agent
should be MOVED here. The Makefile `css` target should output to web/static/css/app.css.
